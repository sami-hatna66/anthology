# Anthology

Anthology is a cataloguing application for amateur collectors. Users can create collections, add items, view statistics, export collections and loan out items, among other things. The application has a Python/Qt frontend and a MySQL backend. Anthology was programmed for my A Level computer science coursework. I have also uploaded a copy of the report I wrote for that project to this repository.

# Installation
Anthology requires the following dependencies to be installed via pip
* PyQt5
* mysql-connector-python
* pyDrive (for Google Drive API)
* matplotlib
* opencv-python-headless
* pyzbar
* tabulate

Anthology also requires MySQL to be installed on your computer. You can install MySQL [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
You will also need [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) to run the setup code.
