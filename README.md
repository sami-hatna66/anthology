# Anthology

Anthology is a cataloguing application for amateur collectors. Users can create collections, add items, view statistics, export collections and loan out items, among other things. The application has a Python/Qt frontend and a MySQL backend. Anthology was programmed for my A Level computer science coursework. I have also uploaded a copy of the report I wrote for that project to this repository.
